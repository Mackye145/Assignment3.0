      <p><strong>My Profile</strong></P>
	  <h3><strong>What is my interest in IT?</strong></h3>
		<p>My interest in IT is with software development, I really like programming as it's a topic that I am passionate about,
		working on projects like algorithms, websites (such as this one) and pretty much anything that involves programming;
		Even debugging which can be a pain. I hope to eventually, outside of my hopeful, future professional life as a software 
		developer is to further increase the work on hardware emulation, to help preserve history and archival of programs in the 
		future as I think that it is an extremely important subject. (That and I am a digital hoarder.)</p>
		<h3><strong>When did my interest in IT start?</strong></h3>
		<p>My interest with IT started from a hobby, I love to mess around with old hardware like the Commodore 64 and the NES. 
		   I found out about programming for chip sets like the 6502 when I was 18, messing around with assembly to build small programs 
		   (nothing to fancy), then I moved on to C++ and HTML among other languages. 
		   Mainly my interests came from videogames, (very "original" I know), but I grew to have a huge interest in hardware emulation, 
		   3D graphics, how hardware works in relation to programming.</p>
		<h3><strong>Was there a particular event or person that sparked my interest?</strong></h3>
		<p>There wasn't any particular person or event that piqued my interest in programming, my interest came from finding out about 
		   emulation of the C64, Atari 2600, NES, Sega Genesis and Game Boy. I was fascinated by how much technology had evolved over 
		   an extremely short period of time, compared to every other advancement in out society, this was the moment that I started 
		   messing around with old programming languages and some newer ones.</p>
